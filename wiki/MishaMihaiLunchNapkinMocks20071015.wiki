= First mocks and first class diagram on napkins =

Here they are

== Login and Register page ==

These are pretty standard. In addition:

  * login should have also "Remember Me" checkbox
  * registration page should also have the CAPTCHA part

== Resource Bundle View ==

http://bundzilla.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/resource_bundle_view.jpg

This is a mock of a main page of the application: the resource bundle view. On this page we see the following parts:

  * Header - currently contains only logout link, maybe more of them...
  * Left Menu - tree-based menu system to navigate to different pages
  * Main Panel - when a user click on the left menu item, they are shown the corresponding page

== First Class Diagram ==
