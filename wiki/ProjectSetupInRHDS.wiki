= Introduction =

Let's say you've heard of this project and you're so thrilled about it, that you want to immediately jump in and help us with its development. Now the question is: how do you setup your development environment to be as productive as any other of its old-timers? 

Well, good question, and better yet, you came to the right place with it. This document is supposed to provide you with its ultimate answer.

== Installing Red Hat Developer Studio (RHDS) ==

The first step for setting up the project in Red Hat Developer Studio (_RHDS_) is... well, _getting_ the IDE. That is, if you don't have it, and given that it's not {{{[}}}yet{{{]}}} one of the most ubiquitous IDEs in the market, you probably don't. 

If the title hasn't gotten you concerned yet, now it's time you might be thinking about these: 
# you don't know how to use it, and 
# you may not be able to afford it. Well, money is no problem - like most things from the boss of Java with a Red Hat, it's free. About how to use it, there's nothing I can do except from helping you learn it, but chances are that you've worked with Eclipse, in which case you're home: RHDS is nothing but a re-branded, vamped-up version of Eclipse. More features, and probably more bugs. 

Now that you've started feeling relaxed again and lost {{{[}}}most of{{{]}}} the mutinous thoughts, here's where you get it from [http://www.redhat.com/developers/rhds/index.html here]. Note that it's version Beta 2, based on Eclipse Europa, and it's still buggy, especially in the SEAM part. The URL might change in the future, as they -hopefully- update with new Beta versions (or even the bug-free release one ;)), so feel free to google for it if our link gets out of sync. 

== Downloading SVN ==


== Checking out (downloading) the code from SVN ==

Once you've installed RHDS, you can move on to downloading the project. If you're reading this page, you probably know already where to get it from. Just in case you don't, here are the [http://code.google.com/p/bundzilla/source instructions].
