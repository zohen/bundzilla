#summary Importing the Bundzilla Projects in RHDS

We hope you reached this page after you checked [PrimingRHDSForSeam]. If not, we urge you to follow [PrimingRHDSForSeam those] instructions, or you will not be able to build Bundzilla in RHDS. 

Assuming you _did_ follow those instructions and you're ready to move on to the next step, here's what needs to be done: you got to import all the Bundzilla projects into your RHDS. If you used the names we asked you to in the [PrimingRHDSForSeam priming instructions], everything should compile right away following the import.
