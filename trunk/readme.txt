Bundzilla
====================
These are the sources of the Bundzilla project. If you're one of its developers, we recommend you to work on it from Red Hat Developer Studio (RHDS) and use the build file only as an additional verification. RHDS is currently only in Beta 2 and extremely buggy in the Seam section, so you're forgiven till JBoss gets it more mature :D. 

If you want to build and install Bundzilla in production, however, forget about RHDS - you MUST use these files to get the production version. 

If you've downloaded the binaries and still see this file, well, excuse us for not taking it out, let us know we did this mishap, and... Happy Bundling!
