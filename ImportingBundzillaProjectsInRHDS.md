We hope you reached this page after you checked [PrimingRHDSForSeam](PrimingRHDSForSeam.md). If not, we urge you to follow [those](PrimingRHDSForSeam.md) instructions, or you will not be able to build Bundzilla in RHDS.

Assuming you _did_ follow those instructions and you're ready to move on to the next step, here's what needs to be done: you got to import all the Bundzilla projects into your RHDS. If you used the names we asked you to in the [priming instructions](PrimingRHDSForSeam.md), everything should compile right away following the import.

## The import ##
You need to import the Bundzilla projects one by one into RHDS. Here are the steps:
  1. Choose File -> Import from the menu:

  1. Copy from an Explorer window the path to the top Bundzilla folder and paste it into the "Select root directory" box (or type it in manually); click "Browse".

  1. Make sure all the 4 projects are selected, the "Copy projects into workspace" box is unselected, and hit "Finish".
  1. Your IDE should now look like this:
